Bill Evans is the greatest jazz pianist ever. The song's inspiration is his brother, Fred Evans, a jazz star, and is on his way to a gold medal at the Olympics in 2002.

In 1975, he recorded "The Love and the Soul" in his own studio, and also produced the Beatles' "All I Need Is Love" and "All I Want Is Love."

In 1981, he performed the song for a TV ad campaign that was picked up for the fifth time. He also got a promotion for "Ink On Your Face," which sold about 3,000 copies to nearly half of the country. He was elected to that spot in 1983, but was also cast in that role again in 1987. The movie was supposed to appear in 2004, but a scheduling error led production back to Broadway. In 2009, he made his Broadway debut as the late Robert Downey Jr., playing Henry Gresham.<|endoftext|>
